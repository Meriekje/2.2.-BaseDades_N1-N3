# Virtual Pets Frontend

A React/Next.js frontend for the Virtual Pets application.

## What is this?

This is a **standalone frontend** that shows animated virtual pets (Mole, Magpie, Toad) that you can:
- 🍎 **Feed** to reduce hunger
- 🎮 **Play** with to increase happiness  
- 😴 **Rest** to restore energy
- ➕ **Adopt** new pets
- 🗑️ **Release** pets you no longer want

## Getting Started

### 1. Create the project folder:
\`\`\`bash
mkdir virtual-pets-frontend
cd virtual-pets-frontend
\`\`\`

### 2. Copy all the files from the code above into your folder

### 3. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### 4. Run the development server:
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### 5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## File Types Explained

- **.tsx** = TypeScript + React (HTML-like syntax with types)
- **.ts** = TypeScript (JavaScript with types)
- **.js** = JavaScript configuration files
- **.css** = Styling
- **.json** = Configuration and package info
- **.md** = Documentation (like this file)

## Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** with gradients and animations
- 🐭 **3 Pet Types** - Mole, Magpie, Toad with unique behaviors
- 📊 **Pet Stats** - Happiness, Energy, Hunger with progress bars
- ✨ **Animations** - Pets react to your actions
- 📱 **Responsive** - Works on desktop and mobile

## How it works (for now)

- **No backend needed** - Everything runs in the browser
- **Mock data** - Pets are stored in memory (refresh = reset)
- **Simulated actions** - Feed/Play/Rest update pet stats locally

Later you can connect this to your Spring Boot backend!
